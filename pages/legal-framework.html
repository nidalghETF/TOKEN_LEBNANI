            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>1. DUAL JURISDICTION STRUCTURE</h2>
                <p>Our legal framework is built on a "Ring-Fenced" dual-jurisdiction model. This structure separates the operational risk of the technology platform from the asset-specific risks of the real estate. This ensures maximum protection for investors and strict compliance with both ADGM (English Common Law) and Lebanese Civil Law.</p>

            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>2. THE REGULATORY PATHWAY</h2>
                <h3>Our Strategy: From RegLab Sandbox to Full Authorization.</h3>
                <p>The legal structure of Token Lebnani is architected specifically to satisfy the FSRA (Financial Services Regulatory Authority) regarding "Arranging Deals in Investments" while strategically avoiding the heavy capital burdens of "Custody" or "Operating an Exchange."</p>
                
                <h3>Phase 1: The Sandbox Entry (Year 1)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Status:</span> Application to the FSRA RegLab Sandbox.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Permission Sought:</span> "Arranging Deals in Investments" (Category 4 scope).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Capital Structure:</span> We satisfy the capital adequacy requirements for a "Restricted" license category (Base Capital ~$10,000 - $50,000 USD) by demonstrating adequate resources for the testing period, rather than the $4M+ requirement for Custody licenses.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Liquidity Strategy (No Lock-Up):</span> We avoid the "Operating an Investment Exchange" (OIE) classification by outsourcing secondary trading. We execute Listing Agreements with existing ADGM-licensed Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs). This provides investors with immediate liquidity from Day 1 without Token Lebnani incurring the $140,000+ capital requirement for an Exchange license.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Phase 2: The Rollout (Year 2)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Status:</span> Transition from Sandbox to Full Authorization.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Expansion:</span> Activation of secondary trading across multiple ADGM-licensed MTFs.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Governance:</span> Implementation of a full internal compliance framework, transitioning from outsourced advisory to a hybrid internal/oversight model.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Phase 3: Full Operations (Year 3+)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Status:</span> Full Category 4 (Arranging) License.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Expansion:</span> Horizontal expansion into Egypt (Mega Market) and Vertical expansion into SME Equity.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Scalability:</span> The "Partner Liquidity" model allows us to scale asset volume without linearly increasing our regulatory capital obligations.</li>

                <h2>3. THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (DIGISHARES & SMART CONTRACTS)</h2>
                <h3>The Technology Layer: Digishares Institutional White-Label</h3>
                <p>We utilize the Digishares platform to ensure institutional-grade security (ISO 27001) and regulatory compatibility.</p>
                
                <h4>Issuance Module</h4>
                <p>Handles the creation of the Smart Contracts and the minting of security tokens (ERC-1400 or equivalent standard for Real World Assets).</p>
                
                <h4>Wallet Integration (Non-Custodial)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Protocol:</span> Integration via WalletConnect.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Implication:</span> Investors maintain custody of their private keys (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger). Token Lebnani never has access to investor funds or keys, satisfying ADGM "Non-Custodial" requirements and eliminating counterparty risk.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>STO Management</h4>
                <p>Automates the Whitelisting of investors based on KYC/AML status. Only wallets whitelisted by Waystone/Compliance can hold tokens.</p>
                
                <h4>Secondary Market Liquidity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Technical Reality:</span> Digishares is an Issuance Platform, not an Exchange. It has no internal order book.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Execution:</span> We utilize Digishares' API Integration Module. This module pushes token data to the Partner MTF's order books. Investors trade on the MTF; the Digishares ledger updates automatically to reflect the new owner.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Smart Contract Layer: Programmed Equity</h3>
                <p>The token is a programmable security on a public blockchain.</p>
                
                <h4>Transferability</h4>
                <p>The contract supports standard transfer functions. Investors can move tokens freely between whitelisted wallets or to the Partner MTF for trading.</p>
                
                <h4>Dividend Distribution (The "Pull" Mechanism)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Technical Reality:</span> Due to security protocols (and WalletConnect limitations), tokens cannot passively receive "pushed" dividends like a bank account.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Mechanism:</span> The Smart Contract includes a distribute function. When the SPV distributes Net Operating Income (NOI), funds are deposited into the contract. Investors receive a notification to "Claim" their dividend. This ensures the transaction is explicitly signed by the investor's private key, preventing unauthorized transfers to lost or compromised wallets.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h3>3.1 SECURITY & ASSET PROTECTION</h3>
                <h4>Smart Contract Audits</h4>
                <p>Prior to any Mainnet launch, the Smart Contract code undergoes a formal security audit by a Tier-1 blockchain security firm (e.g., CertiK, ConsenSys Diligence). The Audit Report is published publicly to satisfy MTF listing requirements and investor due diligence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h3>3.2 KEY MANAGEMENT & ASSET RECOVERY (THE CONCIERGE SAFETY NET)</h3>
                <h4>The Challenge:</h4>
                <p>In traditional crypto, lost private keys mean lost assets. For our HNWI demographic, this risk is unacceptable.</p>
                
                <h4>The Solution: The "Blacklist & Replace" Protocol</h4>
                <p>Token Lebnani utilizes a controlled recovery mechanism to assist investors in the event of lost access or theft, without compromising the integrity of the blockchain ledger.</p>
                
                <h4>The Operational Workflow:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Verification:</span> The investor (or their legal heir) contacts the Client Services Coordinator and provides legal proof of identity and loss of access (e.g., affidavit of loss, police report for theft, death certificate).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Blacklisting:</span> The Compliance Officer (via Multi-Sig authorization) triggers the freezeAccount function in the Smart Contract. The compromised wallet is immediately blocked from moving tokens.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Re-Minting:</span> An equivalent number of tokens is minted and sent to the investor's new, verified wallet address.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Record Integrity:</span> The original transaction history on the blockchain remains intact for audit purposes, satisfying MTF and ADGM record-keeping requirements.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Security Protocol:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The ability to Blacklist or Mint is protected by a Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Wallet. No single individual at Token Lebnani can unilaterally move investor funds or alter the ledger.</li>
                    <li>This service is a fee-based concierge add-on to prevent abuse and cover administrative costs.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The "Look-Through" Mechanism (Crucial):</h3>
                <p>We rely on a specialized legal structure (drafted by YazConsult) where the Articles of Association (AoA) of the Lebanese SPV explicitly recognize the ADGM Token Ledger as the definitive register of shareholders. This ensures that while the ADGM HoldCo is the "face" of the owner, the rights to profits and sale proceeds flow contractually to the Token Holders.</p>

                <h4>The Sale of the Underlying Asset:</h4>
