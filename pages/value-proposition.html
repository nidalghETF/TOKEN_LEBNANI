                <h2>Core Value Proposition</h2>
                <p>Token Lebnani solves the critical liquidity problem for Lebanese real estate by creating a regulated bridge between illiquid physical assets and the digital investment expectations of GCC investors.</p>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <h3>Unlocking $150B in Trapped Wealth</h3>
                    <p>The Lebanese diaspora holds an estimated $150 billion in wealth, much of it sitting in low-yield accounts due to the inability to safely invest back home. Token Lebnani provides the regulated pathway to unlock this value.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <h3>ADGM Regulatory Safety</h3>
                    <p>By domiciling in the Abu Dhabi Global Market, we provide institutional-grade legal protection under English Common Law, addressing the trust gap that has prevented diaspora investment in Lebanese assets.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <h3>Non-Custodial Security Model</h3>
                    <p>Unlike traditional platforms, we operate under "Option A" - investors retain full custody of their assets via their own wallets, eliminating counterparty risk while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>Market Differentiation</h2>
                
                <h3>Asset-First Approach</h3>
                <p>While competitors often sell tokens first and seek assets later (creating synthetic risk), Token Lebnani acquires and legally structures the physical asset before tokenization begins. This ensures each token represents genuine ownership in a tangible asset with verified title.</p>
                
                <h3>Capital-Efficient Regulatory Strategy</h3>
                <p>By utilizing the ADGM "Category 4: Arranging" license framework and partnering with existing MTFs for secondary liquidity, we avoid the $4M+ capital requirements of custody licenses and $140,000+ costs of exchange licenses, allowing us to operate lean while maintaining full compliance.</p>
                
                <h3>Immediate Liquidity Guarantee</h3>
                <p>Unlike traditional real estate investments with 5-10 year lockups, or even competitors with 12-24 month restrictions, Token Lebnani tokens can be traded on partner ADGM-licensed MTFs from day one, providing unprecedented liquidity for real estate investments.</p>
