                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>Token Lebnani represents a pioneering cross-border real estate tokenization platform that bridges the regulatory safety of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) with high-yield Lebanese real estate assets. Our business model is designed to unlock approximately $150 billion in trapped diaspora wealth while providing institutional-grade protection under English Common Law.</p>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <h3>Core Value Proposition</h3>
                    <p>We solve the critical liquidity problem for Lebanese real estate by creating a regulated bridge between illiquid physical assets and the digital investment expectations of GCC investors, with immediate secondary market liquidity through ADGM-licensed MTFs.</p>

                <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
                
                <h3>Target Market</h3>
                <p>Our primary market consists of Lebanese diaspora high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and professional investors based in GCC countries (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait). Secondary markets include non-Lebanese GCC investors seeking exposure to emerging market real estate with institutional protection.</p>
                
                <h3>Market Size</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Total Addressable Market (TAM):</span> $150+ billion in Lebanese diaspora wealth</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):</span> $25-30 billion in GCC-based Lebanese HNWI wealth seeking real estate exposure</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):</span> $150-200 million in Year 1 capital deployment capacity</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
                <p>The MENA real estate tokenization market is in its infancy. While UAE platforms like SmartCrowd and DIFX exist, none offer cross-border solutions for Lebanese assets with ADGM regulatory protection. Our first-mover advantage in this specific niche creates significant barriers to entry.</p>
