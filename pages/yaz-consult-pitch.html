            <h2>LEGAL OVERVIEW (YAZCONSULT PITCH)</h2>
            <h3>(Targeted Pitch to Secure Legal Partnership & Board Seat)</h3>
            <h2>LEGAL & REGULATORY STRATEGY: THE ADGM-LEBANON BRIDGE</h2>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW: THE LEGAL CHALLENGE</h2>
                <p>Token Lebnani is not merely a crowdfunding platform; it is a complex cross-border legal infrastructure project designed to unlock illiquid Lebanese Real Estate assets through the regulatory safety of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).</p>
                <p>The core legal challenge is two-fold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">The Trust Gap:</span> Bridging Lebanese physical assets with the digital expectations of GCC investors.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">The Jurisdictional Bridge:</span> Harmonizing Lebanese property law with ADGM English Common Law and FSRA regulations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We are seeking a legal partner who possesses deep expertise in both jurisdictions to architect the "Legal Wrapper" that makes this bridge secure and enforceable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>2. THE TRANSACTIONAL ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                <p>Our proposed model relies on a Multi-Layered Corporate Hierarchy to ensure risk isolation and legal clarity. We require advisory counsel to validate and structure the following:</p>
                
                <h3>Layer 1: The ADGM SPV (The Issuer)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domiciled in ADGM (Al Maryah Island).</li>
                    <li>Acts as the owner of the token issuance rights.</li>
                    <li>Function: Holds the FSRA Category 4 (Arranging) License.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Layer 2: The Lebanese Property Co. (The Asset Owner)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Lebanese Limited Liability Company (SARL) holding the title deed to the specific real estate asset.</li>
                    <li>The Legal Question: How do we ensure the token holder's rights in the ADGM SPV are legally enforceable against the Lebanese property title?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Layer 3: The Facilities Management (Operations)</h3>
                <p>An independent third-party contractor handling rent collection and maintenance, keeping the SPV "passive" for regulatory purposes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>3. REGULATORY PERIMETER (FSRA STRATEGY)</h2>
                <p>Token Lebnani is pursuing a capital-efficient regulatory pathway within the ADGM FSRA RegLab Sandbox. Our strategy is predicated on strict adherence to a specific regulatory category:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Target License:</span> Category 4 (Arranging Deals in Investments).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Capital Efficiency:</span> Utilizing a framework that minimizes capital requirements while maintaining full compliance (vs. heavy Custody/Exchange license burdens).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Liquidity Strategy:</span> To ensure immediate liquidity without Exchange classification, we will utilize ADGM-licensed Partner MTFs for secondary trading. Legal counsel must ensure the Primary Issuance structure remains distinct from the Secondary Trading venue.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Non-Custodial Status:</span> We operate under "Option A," meaning investors hold their own private keys. We do not take custody of client assets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Partner Opportunity</h3>
                <p>We require counsel to draft the Token Purchase Agreement (TPA) and the Smart Contract Legal Wrapper, ensuring that the transaction mechanism is legally binding under ADGM law and recognized by investors.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>4. CROSS-BORDER ENFORCEABILITY (THE YAZCONSULT MANDATE)</h2>
                <p>This is the specific area where YazConsult's expertise is critical. We need to solve the following legal equation:</p>
                <p class="key-point">"How does a digital token holder in ADGM prove ownership of a brick-and-mortar building in Beirut in a Lebanese court?"</p>
                
                <h3>Scope of Work Required:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Legal Opinion:</span> A formal Tier-1 Legal Opinion confirming that the shareholding structure of the Lebanese SPV is valid and that the rights of the ADGM Holding Company are recognized under Lebanese Law.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Enforceability:</span> Drafting of shareholder agreements that grant the ADGM entity irrevocable rights to the Lebanese SPV's assets (profits and title) in a way that survives Lebanese insolvency or transfer disputes.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Succession Planning:</span> Legal frameworks for inheritance of tokens and how they translate to inheritance of real estate rights in Lebanon.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
                <h2>5. TECHNOLOGY & RISK MITIGATION</h2>
                <p>While the technology is provided by Digishares and compliance oversight by Waystone, the legal integration requires your oversight:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Smart Contract Audits:</span> While Digishares handles code auditing, we need legal counsel to audit the logic of the contract (e.g., Does the dividend distribution function violate Lebanese foreign exchange controls?).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">AML/CFT Bridge:</span> Ensuring that the KYC data collected on-chain (via Sumsub/Trulioo) meets the evidentiary standards of Lebanese due diligence laws.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="document-section">
